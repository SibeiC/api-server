## Overview

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot
is [springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi/tree/main/springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui)

Start your server as a simple java application

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost/

## Useful Scripts

```bash
install.sh
install-dev.sh
uninstall.sh
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add classdoc when enough free AI credit is available
- [ ] Centralized logging place
- [ ] Integrate with mongo cloud storage
- [x] Set up Prometheus monitoring
- [ ] Add more metrics to collect, like certificate issued to whom and how long

## Debug

```bash
sudo journalctl -xeu nginx.service
docker logs api-server
less /var/log/nginx/api-server.access.log
